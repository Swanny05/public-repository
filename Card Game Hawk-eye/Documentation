Description

I have chosen the software engineering task for my demonstration making a similar variation of the game higher or lower,
as I thought it was best suited to show my skills which I have done in C++. It includes the random creation of a 52 card
deck with specific functions as well as functions for printing and shuffling it. 

There is also a nested loop for the game in the main class which implements the rules of the game and gives the user a 
clear understanding of how to play. One mechanic is the freeze option which allows the player to pass on play while saving
their current state in hopes of getting a better card. There are extra options to use when running the game, pressing 'p' 
will print out the current pack in use and 's' will shuffle the current deck in use. These are not intended for player use 
but can be used for ease of function display.

Improvements

If I had more time I would have included some of the following:
- an option to add jokers to the pack and have them play as wild cards so the user gets a bonus point
- a question selector so between turns and when deciding who goes first a question is asked and if the
player is correct they get to play
- also if there were questions in the game in the future the game could be broken into categories such 
as age related, revision topics or general knowledge which the user can chose from at the start 
- sometimes the game might need to take a few times to run as the function to create the deck could be 
more optimised
- a GUI with images of the cards and a welcome page
